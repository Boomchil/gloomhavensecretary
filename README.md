# Gloomhaven Secretary

An open source Gloomhaven Helper clone made as web app with Angular.

This is basically a clone implementing the same functionality and look&feel of the original Gloomhaven Helper since I am not capable of good design/UX. So feel free to contribute better assets.

## Known issues

- Menus don't seem to work on mobile, please try desktop mode on mobile

## Missing / Upcoming

- most monster/character/scenario data
- i18n support (WIP)
- summons
- standalone app (Electron/PWA)
- releases for easier self hosting
- server part to sync states
- load (JSON-)data from URL, so easier custom content integration

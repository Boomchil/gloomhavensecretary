# Gloomhaven Secretary

[Latest Demo](https://lurkars.github.io/gloomhavensecretary/)

An open source Gloomhaven Helper clone made as web app with Angular.

This is basically a clone implementing the same functionality and look&feel of the original Gloomhaven Helper since I am not capable of good design/UX. So feel free to contribute better assets.

## Missing / Upcoming

- most ~~monster\/character~~ scenario data
- ~~i18n support~~
- ~~summons~~
- standalone app with Electron (WIP)\/~~PWA~~
- ~~releases for easier self hosting~~
- server part to sync states
- load (JSON-)data from URL, so easier custom content integration (WIP)


## Install

Download [latest release](https://github.com/Lurkars/gloomhavensecretary/releases/latest) zip-file and unzip content on a webserver.

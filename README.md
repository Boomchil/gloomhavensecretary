# Gloomhaven Secretary

[Latest Online Version](https://lurkars.github.io/gloomhavensecretary/)

An open source [Gloomhaven Helper](http://esotericsoftware.com/gloomhaven-helper) (by [Esoteric SoftwareÂ®](http://esotericsoftware.com)) clone made as web app with Angular. *Gloomhaven Secretary* is a companion app and does basically bookkeeping of all entities values to gain more focus on gameplay.

This is basically a clone implementing the same functionality and look&feel of the original Gloomhaven Helper since I am not capable of good design/UX. So feel free to contribute better assets.

For usage with multiple clients sharing the same game, the server component [Gloomhaven Secretary Server](https://github.com/Lurkars/ghs-server) is required. A public instance is available under `ghs.champonthis.de/server` port `443` with `secure` option.

> SPOILER WARNING:
> The `label.json` files inside the `data`-folder and therefore the final edition data files inside the `src/assets/data`-folder contain spoilers by including the corresponding label.

## Personal disclaimer

This is a hobby project I do in my free-time. The software provides a practical need due to the end of the original Helper app and so I completely follow the **Quick'n'Dirty** approach to get things fast done. This leads of course to a lack of quality and testing and the code base does definitely not comply with my profession.
